# On scroll animation, but in react!

This mini Project allows an svg animation to play when a user is scrolling. I always loved animation on a webpage and I decided to learn to do so.
I used two packages: smooth-scrollbar and lottie-web, in order to make the svg to work properly. I believe smooth-scrollbar isnt necessary, but React's dom is a hassle to work with and smooth-scrollbar makes it so much easier. 

All svg animation is from https://lottiefiles.com/, a fanatic site for really high quality animation! and the best part! Most of it is FREE!!!!

I use this codepen as reference: https://codepen.io/mertmayda/pen/zYvPQQo, this is code in vanilla JS, I just convert it to React Hooks!!
